# Quiz App

This is a quiz app created using a React/Typescript front-end, which fetches quiz questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API via REST.

## Build

To run the application, use a terminal to navigate to the `qui-ui` directory and run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the dependencies required for the front-end.

## Run

To run the application, from the same directory you can run:

### `npm start`

This will spin up a node server that will serve the site on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## More Information

More information can be found within the react-typescript-quiz module's README.md, which was created using [Create-React-App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## The Future

I intend to build my own back-end for this application, that will be similar to the Open Trivia Database API.
